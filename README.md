### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

```css
  .card {
      background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      text-align: center;
      width: 95%;
      max-width: 21em;
      padding: 1rem;
      border-radius: 1.3em;
      margin: auto;
  }   

```
I have learned not to use fix width or height because this might cause problems with page responsiveness.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I would like to learn CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This site helped me the most because most of the info I needed was there.
